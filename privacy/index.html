<h3 id="3-cookies-what-are-cookies-">3. COOKIES What are cookies?</h3>
<p>We may collect information using &#x201C;cookies.&#x201D; Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Sites/Apps/Services. </p>
<p>We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites/Apps/Services; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Sites/Apps/Services, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites. </p>
<p><strong>Cookies we use</strong></p>
<p>Our Sites/Apps/Services uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below: </p>
<p><strong><em>Essential Cookies</em></strong>: These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Sites/Apps/Services and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Sites/Apps/Services and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</p>
<p><strong><em>Functionality Cookies</em></strong>: These cookies allow our Sites/Apps/Services to remember choices you make when you use our Sites/Apps/Services, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Sites/Apps/Services which you can customize. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Sites/Apps/Services. </p>
<p><strong><em>Analytics and Performance Cookies</em></strong>: These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Sites/Apps/Services and how users use our Sites/Apps/Services. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. It includes the number of visitors to our Sites/Apps/Services, the websites that referred them to our Sites/Apps/Services, the pages they visited on our Sites/Apps/Services, what time of day they visited our Sites/Apps/Services, whether they have visited our Sites/Apps/Services before, and other similar information.  We use this information to help operate our Sites/Apps/Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Sites/Apps/Services.</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how our Sites/Apps/Services works. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here:  <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies">https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies</a></p>
<p>You can find out more about how Google protects your data here: <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a>.</p>
<p>You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Sites/Apps/Services by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Targeted and advertising cookies</em></strong>: These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show adverts which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites.</p>
<p>You can disable cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices</a>. If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see adverts but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored adverts from companies that are not listed.</p>
<p><strong>Disabling cookies</strong></p>
<p>You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the &#x201C;settings,&#x201D; &#x201C;help&#x201D; &#x201C;tools&#x201D; or &#x201C;edit&#x201D; facility).

<h3 id="4-pixel-tags">4. PIXEL TAGS</h3>
<p>We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Sites/Apps/Services to track the actions of users on our Sites/Apps/Services. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Sites/Apps/Services, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags is not linked to our users&#x2019; personal data.</p>

<p>Some Internet browsers may be configured to send &#x201C;Do Not Track&#x201D; signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to do not track signals.
