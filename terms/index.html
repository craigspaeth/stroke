<h3 id="17-dispute-resolution-">17. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</h3>
<p>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (&#x201C;<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>&#x201D;) carefully.  It requires you to arbitrate disputes with OHGI and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.  </p>
<p><strong>17.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</strong>. You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Website, App or Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with OHGI, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) you or OHGI may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  <strong>This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</strong></p>
<p><strong>17.2 Arbitration Rules and Forum</strong>.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to us addressed to Sandeep Acharya at 286 Madison Avenue, Floor 22, New York, NY 20017.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.   Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys&#x2019; fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS&#x2019;s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS&#x2019;s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>.  JAMS&#x2019;s rules are also available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS&#x2019;s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, OHGI will pay them for you.  In addition, OHGI will reimburse all such JAMS&#x2019;s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  </p>
<p>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p>
<p><strong>17.3 Authority of Arbitrator</strong>.  The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and OHGI.   The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum&#x2019;s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. </p>
<p><strong>17.4 Waiver of Jury Trial</strong>.  YOU AND OHGI HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and OHGI are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 17.1 above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.   However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>
<p><strong>17.5 Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief</strong>.

The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.   Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys\u0026#x2019; fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS\u0026#x2019;s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at \u003ca href=\"http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/\"\u003ehttp://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/\u003c/a\u003e; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS\u0026#x2019;s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at \u003ca href=\"http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/\"\u003ehttp://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/\u003c/a\u003e.

If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS\u0026#x2019;s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, OHGI will pay them for you.  In addition, OHGI will reimburse all such JAMS\u0026#x2019;s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.

The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and OHGI.   The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum\u0026#x2019;s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.

You and OHGI are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 17.1 above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.

If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection\u0026#x2019;s limitations as to a given claim for relief, than then claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in New York, New York.
